# 💡 JavaScript Assignment 2 – Exploring Strings (Part 1 & 2)

This assignment demonstrates foundational JavaScript concepts through string manipulation and output. Divided into two parts, it covers variable declarations, user alerts, console messages, and structured browser output — all essential for mastering JavaScript string handling.

## 📝 About This Assignment

This assignment focuses on practicing core JavaScript concepts through a series of structured tasks. It includes the use of variables, alerts, and browser-based output to build a strong understanding of how JavaScript handles text-based operations.

By completing this assignment, I learned to:

- Declare and use string variables in JavaScript.
- Display user messages using `alert()`.
- Output HTML content dynamically using `document.writeln()`.
- Apply basic styling using inline CSS.
- Organize and write readable, well-structured code.
