💡 JavaScript Assignment 2 – Exploring Strings (Part 1 & 2)  
This assignment demonstrates core JavaScript concepts using string manipulation and output. It is divided into two parts and includes variable declarations, alert messages, and styled content rendered through the browser — all essential for learning how JavaScript handles text.

📝 About This Assignment  
This project focuses on understanding how to work with strings in JavaScript. Each task uses variables and outputs content using `alert()` and `document.writeln()` to show how strings are managed and displayed on the web page.

By completing this assignment, I learned to:

- Declare and use string variables in JavaScript.  
- Show user messages using `alert()`.  
- Output styled content using `document.writeln()`.  
- Use emojis and formatting for clear display.  
- Write and organize clean, readable code.
